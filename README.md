# Express-note-taker

As a business owner, they would be able to write notes and save them. This would allow them to organize thoughts and keep track of the tasks they need to complete.

When I open a note-taking application, I am presented with a landing page that links to a notes page, after clicking the link to the notes page, I am presented with a page with a list of existing notes on the left-hand side, plus fields to enter a note title and notes text on the right-hand side. If I enter a new note title and its text, then in the navigation at the top, there is a Save icon. If I click on the Save icon, then the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column. The left-hand column shows the list of existing notes, and the right column shows that note, and when I click the Write icon at the top of the page, I am presented with fields to enter the note title and text in the right column
